Special Cases : Let G be a connected graph with n>2 vertices, and m edges. (No loops, and no multiple edges.)

Special Case 1: G has a Hamiltonian cycle if the degree of each vertex is at least n/2.

Special Case 2: G has a Hamiltonian cycle if m >= (n^2-3n+6)/2

Special Case 3: Every tournament has a Hamiltonian path.

Special Case 4: G has a Hamiltonian cycle if for any two vertices u and v of G that are not adjacent: deg u+ deg v >= n.

Special Case 5: Let the vertices be indexed x1,x2 ... xn so that degx i <= deg x i+1. If for each k <= n/2, either degx k > k or degx n-k >= n-k , then G has a Hamiltonian cycle
